### 👋 Welcome

Welcome to Swimm’s knowledge management tool for code.

We’ve prepared a Playlist so you’ll get to know Swimm’s features up close.

### About this Playlist

A [playlist](https://docs.swimm.io/Features/Swimm-Playlists/) is a collection of documents grouped together in a particular order.

*   Playlists also include links, videos, Markdown files, and images and live right inside your repo.
    
*   Swimm keeps track of progress in a Playlist, so you don’t have to remember where you’ve left off.
    

### How to get started

*   💪 Play around with the **demo repository** provided so you can see Swimm in action
