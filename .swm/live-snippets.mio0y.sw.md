## What are live Snippets?

Live snippets are pieces of code from your repository, embedded into your documents.

**Example for a live snippet:**

<br/>

The below code defines a function called "$on" that binds an event listener to a target element and takes four arguments. The function uses the addEventListener method of the target object to bind the event listener and passes.<br/>

## The benefits of Swimm Live snippets

✅ Using parts of your code in your documents does most of the work for you. Let the code explain what it does, and you - explain the underlying assumptions and connections between different code areas.

✅ The Swimm Auto-sync algorithm will take care of tracking the code in the document. making sure the document is always up-to-date as the code evolves.
