## What is Swimm

Swimm is the ultimate documentation solution for engineering teams.<br/>
Say goodbye to the hassle of internal code documentation and hello to effortless sharing of developer knowledge across teams and repositories. With Swimm, documenting your code is a breeze:

## How Swimm is different?

**Swimm's patented Auto-sync feature**<br/>
With “Auto-sync,” documentation is always up to date. One of Swimm’s core unique capabilities with Auto-sync is ensuring that your documentation will stay synced with the code as it evolves and changes.

**Our code-coupled editor**<br/>
Swimm created the world's first editor with all the capabilities of rich text, Markdown, and live code snippets embedded in your docs.

**IDE integrations**<br/>
With Swimm, you will consume documentation directly from the IDE. Accessing documentation at the right time means that you have it exactly when you need it. You’ll no longer need to switch contexts from the IDE and an external location for your docs.
