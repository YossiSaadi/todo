"Smart Text" refers to either tokens or paths that are being tracked and synced. Smart Tokens help you keep your documentation up to date by allowing you to reference parts of your code, even outside of snippets, in a way that automatically updates when the code changes. The most common use for Smart Tokens is referencing variable, method, or function names within the document.

## Try it yourself!!
