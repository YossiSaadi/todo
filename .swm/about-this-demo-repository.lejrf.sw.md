This demo repository is a cloned MIT-licensed repository created by [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) and other contributors to help developers become familiar with new frontend technologies. or as they phrase it:

> Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV\* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.
> 
> Backbone, Ember, AngularJS... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?
> 
> We created TodoMVC - `a project which offers the same Todo application` implemented using MV\* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV\* frameworks of today.

You can choose your favorite framework and try it out in Swimm.
